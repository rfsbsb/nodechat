nodechat
========

A simple node.js chat system. Client and server.

Using
=====

In order to use the chat, you must have Node.js installed alongside with _ws_ node module.

After that, you shoud run the server.js in the folder **js/server**. It's important to note that your terminal **must** be inside the **server** folder, since some dependencies are yet hardcoded.

So you shoud have something like

    cd /the/folder/of/nodechat/js/server
    node server.js

If everything is okay, you should point your web browser to http://localhost:8080 in order to access the service.
